This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is a school project in which we have to remake a whole website or app from a famous company, in our case, we chose spotify.
For this approach, i decided to follow a tutorial which i will link later on to learn how Next.js works, among other things like:
Tailwind CSS, Supabase, PostgreSQL and Stripe.

Although it is based off a tutorial, i will be revamping, refactoring and adding new features to the original code based on what i've learned.
Anything needed for this project, feel free to open up an issue and ill review it on my free time.

This project has a due date, which means it may be discontinued after January 12th
